# CNN
Convolution Neural Network Demonstration and Visualization

* This CNN was designed to classify images as either Dog or Cat.
* Trained using a total 8000 samples of dogs (4000) and cats (4000). Tested with 2000 samples of cats and dogs (1000 each). 
* You may use your own samples for training and testing.
* Uses Keras with either tensorflow or theanos as a backend. Currently only works with CPU or Nvidia CUDA.
* Acheived about 85% accuracy with 2 convolution (with 32 filters of size 3x3) and pooling layers (with a pool size of 2x2)
